# AN2DL-challenges
# Challenges of Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning course #
### @Politecnico di Milano, Academic Year 2021-2022 ###
The aim of the two challenges was to develop multiples models of neural network in order to solve specific problems.
##### Challenge1 - leaf challenge #####
In the first challenge we had to create a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of leaves contained in a dataset. The dataset was given by the teacher
##### Challenge2 - timeseries challenge #####
In the second challenge we had to create a Neural Network to predict future samples of a multivariate series.
