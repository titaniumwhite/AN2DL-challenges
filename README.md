The aim of the two challenges was to develop multiples models of neural network in order to solve specific problems.
##### Challenge1 - leaf challenge #####
This first challenge aimed to classify images of leaves using a CNN. It began with dataset analysis and preprocessing, including data augmentation to enhance the model's ability to handle diverse leaf images. Additionally, class imbalance was addressed, and the dataset was divided into training and validation sets. Callbacks were used to monitor and optimize the learning process.
##### Challenge2 - timeseries challenge #####
In the second challenge we had to create a Neural Network to predict future samples of a multivariate series.
